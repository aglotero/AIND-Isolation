# Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search

## The problem

Games with perfect information have a function to calculate the game outcome, 
using this function you can build a tree with all possible moves and search in this
tree the next move that takes you on a win situation.

Besides, the complexity increases as the board size and quantity of moves increases. 
Such games has a tree of size `$b^d$` where `b` is the number of legal moves per move
and `d` is the length of the game.   

MiniMax and Alpha Beta pruning does not allows a search in a feasible time on such huge trees.
